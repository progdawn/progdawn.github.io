Final Project for VICOM 128 and ITDEV 161. A website for Splatoon 2.

This is the final project for my VICOM 128 and ITDEV 161 classes. Working off of a project I played with over the summer, this is a website that has some references and resources for the Nintento Switch game Splatoon 2.

Initially I will be meeting the requirements for the Visual Communications 128 class, "Web Development with HTML/CSS". Once that is complete, I will be adding in material to meet the IT Development 161 class, "Web Programming 1". This will include Angular, AJAX, and PHP.
