		<h1>What are mechanical keyboards?</h1>
		
		<p>An introduction to an expensive hobby that fills the gap in your soul.</p>
		
		<h2>A brief explanation, courtesy of Wikipedia</h2>
		
		<p>Mechanical-switch keyboards use separate complete switches underneath every key. Each switch is composed of a base, a spring, and a stem. Depending on the shape of the stem, such keyboards have varying actuation and travel distance. Switches also come in three variants, linear with consistent resistance, and tactile with a non-audible bump or with an audible click. Depending on the resistance of the spring, the key requires different amounts of pressure to actuate. Mechanical keyboards allow for the removal and replacement of keycaps.</p>
		
		<p>The major current mechanical switch producer is Cherry. Alps Electric, a former major producer, ended production in the early 2000s. Companies such as Cooler Master, Corsair, Razer, Thermaltake, Logitech and SteelSeries offer a variety of mechanical model keyboards targeted towards gamers.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Blacks</li>
				<p>Smooth, but no "bump". They feel a bit heavy.</p>
			<li>Reds</li>
				<p>The OG switch. Not terribly loud, but lacks feedback</p>
			<li>Browns</li>
				<p>My personal favorite. The weight is balanced, and the sound doesn't tick off my coworkers</p>
			<li>Blues</li>
				<p>CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK. Feels great, but extremely loud.</p>
