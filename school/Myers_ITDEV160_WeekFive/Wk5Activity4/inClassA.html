		<h1>What I did at work today, part 1</h1>
		<p>A story of how I really broke things</p>
		
		<h2>The problem, or just a symptom?</h2>
		<p>Sometimes problems are actually just a symptom of a bigger problem. 
		Today I continued reproducing a reported issue for our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI_MSP430">
		MSP430</a> device. When someone from a another department asked me how to do something, 
		I figured I would show them on my testing device. Little did I know it would cause me to
		stumble a pretty nasty bug - which is my job!</p>
		
		<h2>Down the rabbit hole</h2>
		<p>My device was locking up pretty bad. Unfortunately one of our developers couldn't usemap
		the same tools I could to reproduce, so we tried a different way that called the same code - 
		but it wouldn't reproduce! The only difference was my method used zigbee communication, and his
		used serial. The code called was the same. Strange!</p>
		
		<h2>No explanation for this</h2>
		<p>When I told my boss, we tried yet a third method for figuring out what device was at fault.
		That's where things went insane. The device locked up, its sibling devices locked up, processes crashed,
		displays flickered, temperatures reported impossible amounts! One little bug lead to us uncovering
		what would have been a fatal flaw in the hands of customers. All in a days work for a thermostat
		tester!</p>
